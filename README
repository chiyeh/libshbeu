===========

libshbeu: A library for controlling the SH-Mobile BEU.

Copyright (C) 2010 Renesas Electronics Corporation

The [SH-Mobile][0] processor series includes a hardware blend engine unit (BEU)
that supports image overlay.

This source archive contains:

 * src/libshbeu: the libshbeu shared library
 * src/tools: commandline tools

libshbeu API
------------

libshbeu allows both synchronous and asynchronous access to the BEU. The
synchronous API provides a one-shot function shbeu_blend(). The asychronous API
replaces this with a similar but non-blocking function, shbeu_start_blend(),
and a corresponding shbeu_wait().

Please see doc/libshbeu/html/index.html for API details.


shbeu-display
-------------

shbeu-display is a commandline program for displaying raw image or video files.
It uses the SH-Mobile BEU to perform simultaneous colorspace conversion and
blending on each input frame. It allows the user to pan the foremost image.

    Usage: shbeu-display [options] -i <input file>
    Overlays raw image data using the SH-Mobile BEU and displays on screen.
    Options and input file can be specified for up to 3 inputs, e.g.
      shbeu-display -s vga -i vga.yuv -s qvga -i qvga.rgb -s qcif -i qcif.rgb

    Input options
      -c, --input-colorspace (RGB565, NV12, YCbCr420, YCbCr422)
                             Specify input colorspace
      -s, --input-size       Set the input image size (qcif, cif, qvga, vga, d1, 720p)

    Control keys
      Cursor keys            Pan
      =                      Reset panning
      q                      Quit

    Miscellaneous options
      -h, --help             Display this help and exit
      -v, --version          Output version information and exit

    File extensions are interpreted as follows unless otherwise specified:
      .yuv    YCbCr420
      .rgb    RGB565


SH-Mobile
---------

The [SH-Mobile][0] processor series includes a hardware video engine unit that
supports colorspace conversion, rotation and scaling. Some models also include
support for camera capture, JPEG processing, and DSP instructions.

Kernel configuration
--------------------

libshbeu uses the Linux kernel UIO support for the SH-Mobile BEU, this is not
in the mainline kernel. You will have to manually add this capability.

The following kernel boot option reserves physically contiguous memory for BEU
use:

    memchunk.beu=4m
